# Inheritance

This is a small project that was done for the CS50 course for introduction to programming.

This program simulates what alleles a tree of ancestors would possibly have based on a randomly generated child with a set of alleles (blood type)

This program uses recursion and was the first time I learned how to appy recursion to a problem.
